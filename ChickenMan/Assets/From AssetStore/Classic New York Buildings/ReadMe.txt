Thank you for purchasing the Classic New York buildings. A lot of effort has been put into creating this asset pack and our team is more than willing to help you setup your own scenes.

Problems, help and even more suggestions for what an upgrade should include are welcome.

In order to correctly set this asset pack and enjoy it certain Unity 3D settings must be set.


- Edit>Project Settings>Player : Rendering Path : Deferred, Color Space Linear

The default Settings for the project Scene1 is for Realtime GI. To enjoy it fully some Baking must be done since most Lights Baking option is set to Mixed. Go to Window>Lighting and check Auto for baking. Give it some time cause it is a big scene.

Furthermore all Light Probes are set to Realtime, so you need to change to Baked if you desire a baked scene.

Please contact antonis.fassolas@gmail.com for any additional help.
